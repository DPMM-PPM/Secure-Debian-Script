# automatedlinuxsecurity
This is my attempt at automating the initial process of securing a Debian system. This script is a basic Bash shell script. Please keep in mind, that it only sets up basic security measures. I would recommend you to only use it on a freshly installed system, to prevent damaging your running system.
